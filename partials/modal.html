            <h5 class="section-title">I’m a UI/UX Designer & Frontend Developer based in Calicut, India — crafting
                successful digital products for web and mobile.</h5>
            <p class="section-text">
                I design and build thoughtful digital experiences that balance user needs, business goals, and clean
                execution. I enjoy being involved at every stage of a product’s journey — from the initial spark of an
                idea, through research and wireframes, to polished UI and responsive front-end development.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                As a freelancer and product-focused designer, I can seamlessly step into a project at any phase or take
                full ownership from concept to launch. This end-to-end approach allows me to create cohesive, scalable,
                and user-centric solutions that actually work in the real world.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                I collaborate closely with founders, startups, and teams to transform complex problems into intuitive,
                elegant digital products. If you’re looking for someone who combines UX strategy, visual design, and
                frontend execution, I’d love to connect and explore how we can build something impactful together.
